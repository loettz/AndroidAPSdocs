## Configuration matérielle et logicielle requise

- **Phone:** The Medtronic driver should work with any android phone that supports Bluetooth connections. **IMPORTANT: Phone manufacturers Bluetooth implementations can vary so how each phone model behaves can vary. For example, some phones will handle enabling/disabling Bluetooth differently. This can impact the user experience when AndroidAPS needs to reconnect to your Rileylink type device.**
- **RileyLink Compatible Device:** Android phones cannot communicate to Medtronic pumps without a seperate device to handle communications. This device will link with your phone via Bluetooth and with your pump via a compatible radio connection. The first such device was called a Rileylink but a number of other options are now available which can offer additional functionality.
    
    - Rileylink available at [getrileylink.org](https://getrileylink.org/product/rileylink916)
    - Orangelink available at [getrileylink.org](https://getrileylink.org/product/orangelink)
    - Emalink (multiple model options) available at [github.com](https://github.com/sks01/EmaLink)
    - Gnarl (some additional DIY required) details available at [github.com](https://github.com/ecc1/gnarl)

## Configuration de la pompe

The following settings should be configured on the pump in order for AndroidAPS to remotely send commands. The steps necessary to make each change on a Medtronic 715 are shown in brackets for each setting. The exact steps may vary based on pump type and/or firmware version.

- **Enable remote mode on Pump** (On the pump press Act and go to Utilities -> Remote Options, Select On, and on next screen do Add ID and add any random id such as 111111). At least one ID must be on the Remote ID list in order for the pump to expect remote communication.
- **Set Max Basal** (On the pump press Act and got to Basal and then select Max Basal Rate) As an example setting this value to four times your maximum standard basal rate would allow a 400% Temporary Basal Rate. The maximum value permitted by the pump is 34.9 units per hour.
- **Set Max Bolus** (On the pump press Act and to to Bolus and then select Max Bolus) This is the largest bolus that the pump will accept. The maximum value permitted by the pump is 25.
- **Set profile to Standard**. (On the pump press Act and go to Basal and then Select Patterns) The pump will only need one profile as AndroidAPS will manage different profiles on your phone. No other patterns are required.
- **Set Temporary Basal Rate type** (On the pump press Act and go to Basal and then Temp Basal Type). Select Absolute (not Percent).

## Configuration Medtronic du téléphone / AndroidAPS

- **Do not pair RileyLink compatible device with the Bluetooth menu on your phone.** Pairing via the Bluetooth menu on your phone will stop AndroidAPS from seeing your Rileylink Compatible device when you follow the instructions below. 
- Disable automatic screen rotation on your phone. On certain devices automatic screen rotation causes Bluetooth sessions to restart which would cause issues for your Medtronic pump. 
- There are two ways to configure your Medtronic pump in AndroidAPS: 

1. Using the setup wizard as part of a fresh install
2. By selecting the cog icon beside the Medtronic selection in the pump selection option in Config Builder

When configuring your Medtronic pump with the setup wizard it is possible that you will be prevented from completing setup because of Bluetooth issues (e.g. you cannot succesfully connect to the pump). Should this happen you should select the virtual pump option in order to complete the configuration and allow for further troubleshooting by using option 2.

![Paramètres Medtronic](../images/Medtronic01a.png)

While setting up AndroidAPS to work with your medtronic pump you need to set following items: (see picture above)

- **Pump Serial Number**: Displayed on the back of your pump and starts with SN. You should only enter the 6 numbers shown without any alpabetic characters (e.g. 123456).
- **Pump Type**: The model pump you are using (e.g. 522). 
- **Pump Frequency**: There are two options based on where your pump was originally distributed. Please check the [FAQ](../Configuration/MedtronicPump#faq) if you are unsure which option to select): 
    - pour les US & le Canada, la fréquence utilisée est 916 Mhz
    - pour le reste du monde, la fréquence utilisée est de 868 Mhz
- **Max Basal on Pump (U/h)**: This needs to match the setting set on your pump (see Configuration of the pump above). Again this setting must be carefully selected as it will determine how much AndroidAPS can deliver via your basal rate. This will effectively set the maximum temporary basal rate. As an example, setting this value to four times your maximum standard basal rate would allow a 400% Temporary Basal Rate. The maximum value permitted by the pump is 34.9 units per hour.
- **Max Bolus on Pump (U)** (in an hour): This needs to match the setting set on your pump (see Configuration of the pump above). This setting should be carefully considered as it determines how large a bolus AndroidAPS can ever set.
- **Delay before Bolus is started (s)**: The number of seconds after a bolus is issued before the command is actually sent to the pump. This period of time allows the user to cancel the bolus in the event a bolus command is sent in error. It is not possible to cancel a bolus that has started via AndroidAPS. The only way to cancel a bolus that has already started is to suspend the pump manually followed by resuming it.
- **Medtronic Encoding**: Determines if the medtronic encoding is carried out. Selecting Hardware encoding (i.e. carried out by the Rileylink compatible device) is preferred as this results in less data being sent. Selecting Software encoding (i.e. carried out by AndroidAPS) can help in the event frequent disconnects are seen. This setting will be ignored if you have firmware version 0.x on Rileylink devices.
- **Battery Type (Power View)**: In order to correctly determine the remaining battery power level you should select the type of AAA battery in use. When a value other than simple view is selected AndroidAPS will display the remaining calculated battery percentage level and volts. The following options are available:
    
    - Non sélectionné (vue simple)
    - Alcaline (vue étendue)
    - Lithium (vue étendue)
    - NiZn (vue étendue)
    - NiMH (vue Étendue)
- **Bolus/Treatments Debugging**: Select On or Off depending on requirements.

- **RileyLink Configuration**: This option allows you to find and pair your Rileylink compatible device. Selecting this will show any nearby Rileylink compatible devices and the signal strength.
- **Use Scanning** Activates Bluetooth scanning before connecting with your Rileylink Compatible devices. This should improve the reliability of your connection to the device.
- **Show battery level reported by OrangeLink/EmaLink/DiaLink** This feature is only supported on newer link devices such as the EmaLink or OrangeLink. Values will be shown in the Medtronic tab in AnroidAPS. 
- **Set neutral temp basals** By default Medtronic pumps beep on the hour when a temporary basal rate is active. Enabling this option can help reduce the number of beeps heard by interupting a temporary basal at the hour change in order to supress the beep.

## Onglet MEDTRONIC (MDT)

![Onglet MDT](../images/Medtronic02.png) When AndroidAPS is configured to use a Medtronic pump a MDT tab will be shown in the list of tabs at the top of the screen. This tab displays the current pump status information along with some Medtronic specific actions.

- **RileyLink Status**: The current status of the connection between your phone and Rileylink compatible device. This should show as Connected at all times. Any other status may require user intervention. 
- **RileyLink Battery**: The current battery level of your EmaLink or OrangeLink device. Dependent on selecting "Show battery level reported by OrangeLink/EmaLink/DiaLink device" in the Medtronic Pump Configuration menu.
- **Pump Status**: The current status of the pump connection. As the pump will not be constantly connected this will primarily show the sleep icon. There are a number of possible other status including "Waking Up" when AndroidAPS is trying to issue a command or other possible pump commands such as "Get Time", "Set TBR", etc. 
- **Battery**: Shows battery status based on the value chosen for Battery Type (Power View) in the Medtronic Pump Configuration menu. 
- **Last connection**: How long ago the last succesful pump connection happened.
- **Last Bolus**: How long ago the last succesful bolus was delivered.
- **Base Basal Rate**: This is the base basal rate that runs on pump at this hour in your active Profile.
- **Temp basal**: Temp basal currently being delivered which can be 0 units per hour.
- **Réservoir** : Indique la quantité d'insuline présente dans le réservoir (mise à jour au minimum toutes les heures).
- **Erreurs** : Affiche une erreur en cas d'incident (le plus souvent il s'agit d'une erreur dans la configuration).

At the bottom of the screen there are three buttons:

- **Refresh** is for refreshing the current status of the pump. This should only be used if the connection was lost for a sustained period as this will require a full data refresh (retrieve history, get/set time, get profile, get battery status, etc).
- **Pump History**: Shows pump history (see [below](../Configuration/MedtronicPump#pump-history))
- **RL Stats**: Show RL Stats (see [below](../Configuration/MedtronicPump#rl-status-rileylink-status))

## Historique pompe

![Boîte de dialogue Historique pompe](../images/Medtronic03.png)

L'historique de la pompe est récupéré toutes les 5 minutes et stocké localement. Only the previous 24 hours worth of history is stored. The allows for a convinient way to see pump behaviour should that be required. The only items stored are those relevenant to AndroidAPS and will not inlcude a configuration function that has no relevance.

## État RL (RileyLink État)

![État RileyLink - Paramètres](../images/Medtronic04.png) ![État RileyLink - Historique](../images/Medtronic05.png)

The RL Status dialog has two tabs:

- **Settings**: Shows settings about the RileyLink compatible device: Configured Address, Connected Device, Connection Status, Connection Error and RileyLink Firmware versions. Le type d'appareil est toujours Pompe Medtronic, Modèle affiche votre modèle de pompe, Numéro de série est le numéro de la pompe configuré, Fréquence de pompe indique la fréquence utilisée, Dernière fréquence est la dernière fréquence utilisée.
- **Historique** : Affiche l'historique des communications, pour le RileyLink cela concerne les changements d'état et pour le Medtronic les commandes envoyées à la pompe.

## Actions

When the Medtronic driver is used, two additional actions are added to Actions Tab:

- **Wake and Tune Up** - In the event that AndroidAPS hasn't connected to your pump for a sustained period (it should connect every 5 minutes), you can force a Tune Up. This will try to contact your pump, by searching all of the possible radio frequencies used by your pump. In the event a succesful connection is made the succesful frequency will be set as the default. 
- **Reset RileyLink Config** - If you reset your RileyLink compatible device you may need to use this action so that device can be reconfigured (frequency set, frequency type set, encoding configured).

## Remarques importantes

### Utilisateurs OpenAPS

OpenAPS users should note that AndroidAPS with Medtronic uses a completely different approach than OpenAPS. Using AndroidAPS the primary method of interacting with th pump is via your phone. In normal use cases it is likely that the only time it is required to use the pump menu is when changing resevoirs. This is very different when using OpenAPS where at least some of a bolus is usually delivered via the quick bolus buttons. In the event the pump is used to manually deliver a bolus there can be issues if AndroidAPS attempts to deliver one at the same time. There are checks to try and prevent issues in such cases but this should still be avoided where possible.

### Journaux

In the event you need to troubleshoot your Medtronic pump function select the menu icon in the upper left corner of the screen, select Maintainance and Log Settings. For troubleshooting any Medtronic issues Pump, PumpComm, PumpBTComm should be checked.

### MGC Medtronic 

La MGC Medtronic n'est actuellement PAS prise en charge.

### Utilisation manuelle de la pompe

You should avoid manually bolusing or setting TBRs on your pump. All such commands should be sent via AndroidAPS. In the event manual commands are used there must be a delay of at least 3 minutes between them in order to reduce the risk of any issues.

### Modifications de fuseau horaire, changements d'heure ou Voyage avec la pompe Medtronic et AndroidAPS

AndroidAPS will automatically detect Timezone changes and will update the Pump's time when your phone switches to the new time.

Travelling east means you are going to be adding hours to the current time (ex. from GMT+0 to GMT+2) will not result in any issues as there will be no overlap (e.g. it won't be possible to have the same hour twice). Travelling west however can result in issues as you are effectively going back in time which can result in incorrect IOB data.

The issues seen when travelling west are known to the developers and work on a possible solution is ongoing. See https://github.com/andyrozman/RileyLinkAAPS/issues/145 for more detail. For now, please be aware that this issue may occur and carefully monitor when changing time zones.

### Is a GNARL a fully compatible Rileylink combatible device?

The GNARL code fully supports all of the functions used by the Medtronic driver in AndroidAPS which means it is fully compatible. It is important to note that this will require addtional work as you will have to source compatible hardware and then load the GNARL code on to the device.

**Note de l'auteur :** Veuillez noter que le logiciel GNARL est encore expérimental et légèrement testé, il ne devrait pas être considéré comme aussi sûr à utiliser qu'un RileyLink.

## Questions fréquentes

### Que faire si je perds la connexion à RileyLink et/ou à la pompe ?

There are a number of options to try and resolve connectivity issues.

- Use the "Wake Up and Tune" button in the ACT tab as detailed above.
- Disable Bluetooth on your phone, wait 10 seconds and then enable it again. This will force the Rileylink device to reconnect to the phone.
- Reset the Rileylink device. You must then use the "Reset Rileylink Config" button in the ACT tab.
- Other users have found the following steps to be effective in restoring connectivity when other methods have not: 
    1. Restart the phone
    2. *While* the phone is restarting restart the Rileylink device
    3. Open AndroidAPS and allow the connection to restore

### Comment déterminer la fréquence utilisée par ma pompe

![Modèle de Pompe](../images/Medtronic06.png)

On the back of the pump you will find a line detailing your model number along with a special 3 letter code. The first two letters determine the frequency type and the last one determines color. Voici les valeurs possibles pour la fréquence :

- NA - Amérique du Nord (pour la fréquence, vous devez sélectionner "US & Canada (916 MHz)")
- CA - Canada (pour la fréquence, vous devez sélectionner "US & Canada (916 MHz)")
- WW - Worldwide (pour la fréquence, vous devez sélectionner "Worldwide (868 Mhz)")
